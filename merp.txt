I once met a man named harold
He shot a duck of mallard
All the next day
He prepared it to stay
A full stomach and nothing stalward


knock knock!
"who's there?"
Doris!
"doris who?"
Doris locked. That's why I'm knocking!

merp merp or meep meep?
That is the question

@echo off
:matrix
set /a var = %random% %%99
color %var%
echo %random%%random%%random%
goto matrix

Save that as a .bat and run it. It amkes pretty colors =)
